**Rules of RITS**

1. Ask away. RITS can supply basic information about any TSU 	
   MTCS faculty member, including their e-mail address, website,	
   telephone number, office location and schedule. 

2. Punctuation and capitalization are not important for RITS 	
   to answer your question.

3. Remember to use a title, such as "Dr" or "Professor" 	
   before the name of the person you're asking about.	

4. If there are more than one professor with the same
   last name, RITS will give you the chance to specify which	
   one you are asking about. So no need to include first names	
   in your query. 

5. Check your spelling. RITS won't be able to answer	
   your question if its looking up the the wrong name.
